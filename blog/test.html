						Capoeira music differentiates Capoeira from other martial arts. Music is a very important aspect in Capoeira.

						<br/><br/>The musical variations of the berimbau are the various rhythms performed by the player to define the type of play that will be done on the "roda". A good capoeirista should, or rather, have an obligation, to know the greatest number of rhythms, as well as the meaning and type of game practiced in each of these rhythms.

						 

						<br/><br/>In Capoeira Regional it has only one berimbau and two tambourines(pandeiros), and the litanies(ladainhas) are usually short. And the seven rhythms created by Master Bimba that vary the games.

						The seven rhythms of regional capoeira:

						<br/><br/><strong>IÚNA:</strong> This rhythm was based on the song of the bird Iúna. It is a more in and continuous game, 

							executing movements of "flourish"(floreio), and only the masters and formed can participate in that game. 

							During their performance they use only the instruments, without any hand clapping and they do not sing.

							The Iuna rhythm is composed of two parts, one is the male wooing sounds and the second is the female response.

						<br/><br/><strong>AMAZONAS:</strong> It's the festive rhythm, used to greet visitors from other places and their respective students. 

							It is used in baptisms and gatherings. Some people say that Mestre Bimba created the Amazonas rhythm for a women.

						<br/><br/><strong>CAVALARIA:</strong> It's the warning or alert tone. Its origin goes back to the time of the prohibition of capoeira, 

							when it was used to denounce the presence of the assembled police, of the so-called cavalry squadron. A capoeirista put himself 

							in a strategic place and, when he saw the police, he imitated the horses in the berimbau and the wheel turned into "innocent joke".

							Cavalaria is an old rhythm and is trying to imitate galloping horses because in that times the police came riding on horses.

						<br/><br/><strong>SANTA MARIA:</strong> It is usually used only in presentations and it is related to the game of knife, knife or machete.

							 The Santa Maria rhythm was played to warn the capoeiristas that there is someone with a knife in the roda.

						<br/><br/><strong>BENGUELA:</strong> It is a slow game, loose, flowery and quite disputed, that was introduced to be able to play with 

							the angoleiros. This rhythm has no  hand claping and no singing, it can be played in the beginning of the roda to warm up, 

							Mestre Bimba also used it to calm the Roda if it got to tough.

						<br/><br/><strong>IDALINA:</strong> In this rhythm there is no characteristic type of game clearly defined, being that sometimes 

							prevails in the "performance" of the players certain theatricality that refers to the love conquest. Mestre Bimba usually played Idalina 

							at trainings and unofficial Rodas.

						<br/><br/><strong>SÃO BENTO GRANDE DE BIMBA:</strong> The most common Berimbau rhythm in the Capoeira Regional. This game requires to be played 

							more up (body positioning) than lower, being fast with explosive and traumatic blows.
